          <p className="text-gray-400 text-center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samarth Sharma, a self-taught Full-Stack Developer from India with a passion for building practical and scalable web applications. I specialize in working with the MERN stack, Next.js, and DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD, crafting solutions that are fast, secure, and user-friendly.

              My recent projects include a fully functional Form Builder SaaS, similar to Google Forms, where users can create dynamic forms, publish them, and track live submissions â€” all deployed in a clean, modern UI.

              Beyond just writing code, Iâ€™m focused on solving real-world problems and delivering results that help businesses grow. Iâ€™ve also worked on admin dashboards, business websites, and product landing pages for clients â€” and Iâ€™m always open to freelance opportunities, startup collaborations, or full-time roles.

              When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m learning more about DevOps, exploring Web3, or working on turning ideas into income-generating products.

              ðŸ’¡ I value clean architecture, fast shipping, and building tools that make a real impact.</p>
